## About
discid provides Rust bindings for the MusicBrainz DiscID library [libdiscid](http://musicbrainz.org/doc/libdiscid).
It allows calculating DiscIDs (MusicBrainz and freedb) for Audio CDs. Additionally
the library can extract the MCN/UPC/EAN and the ISRCs from disc.

## Requirements
* libdiscid >= 0.6.0

## Usage

### Read only the TOC

```rust,no_run
use discid::DiscId;

fn main() {
  // Specifying the device is optional. If set to `None` a platform
  // specific default will be used.
  let device = Some("/dev/cdrom");
  let disc = DiscId::read(device).expect("Reading disc failed");
  println!("ID: {}", disc.id());
}
```

### Read the TOC and ISRCs

```rust,no_run
use discid::{DiscId, Features};

fn main() {
  let disc = DiscId::read_features(None, Features::ISRC).expect("Reading disc failed");
  println!("Disc ID: {}", disc.id());

  for track in disc.tracks() {
    println!("Track #{} ISRC: {}", track.number, track.isrc);
  }
}
```
